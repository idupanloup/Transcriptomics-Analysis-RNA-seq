## Overview

This course will provide an overview of the RNA-seq analysis pipeline, as well as the downstream analysis of the resulting data using bioconductor packages in R. The course will cover the following topics:

- The structure of an RNAseq analysis pipeline:
	- Raw data quality check
	- RNAseq reads alignment
	- Gene Expression level quantification and normalization of read counts
- Overview of downstream analysis
	- Differential Expression analysis with R/Bioconductor packages
	- Class discovery: usage of Principal Component Analysis, Clustering, Heatmaps, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis in RNA-seq analysis

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques will not be covered in this course.
Experimental design as well as the statistical methods will not be detailed in this course. 

## Asking questions

During lectures, you are encouraged to raise your hand if you have questions (if in-person), or use the Zoom functionality (if online). Find the buttons in the participants list ('Participants' button):
